In this section, we analyze the causes of incorrect predictions made by GPT-5 under the adaptive mode to understand the gap between adaptive reasoning and oracle-visual mode. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:failure_gpt}, most errors are related to tool usage. Specifically, 42.3\% of the errors stem from visual reasoning failures, such as zoom-in into incorrect regions or applying wrong image transformations. Another 7.3\% of errors occur even when visual reasoning is correct. Since these samples are solvable in the oracle-visual mode, this suggests that intermediate images in multi-step reasoning may introduce visual noise affecting the final prediction. In addition, 8.3\% of errors are caused by incorrect mode selection, where text reasoning is sufficient but the model unnecessarily invokes tools, leading to degraded performance. For cases without tool usage, forcing tool invocation corrects 7.0\% of the errors, while 6.3\% remain incorrect. The remaining 28.8\% of errors exceed the capability of the GPT-5 model.
